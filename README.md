# Modeling Titanic's Passengers Survival

Here I share my Jupyter notebooks on my study of modeling Titanic's passengers survival. You'll find data and scripts you can run.

Titanic's Passengers Survival is a Kaggle challenge.

The lessons I learned from this challenge are available on my blog post: [Lessons Learned from Kaggleâ€™s Titanic Competition](http://htaidirt.com/2016/04/15/lessons-learned-kaggle-titanic-competition/).

You can clone this repo using your terminal:

    git clone git@github.com:htaidirt/Titanic-Kaggle-Challenge.git
    
Enjoy!
